# CryptoPals_Python

I had come across Crypto Pals web site a while ago (2015?). Didn't have time to tackle the challenges then, but now I found some time to deal with Python a bit more.

#Why Python?
I'm trying to learn a new language. (I have the following background in computer programming:

COMMODORE 64: BASIC V2
WINDOWS: GW BASIC, QUICK BASIC, ASSEMBLY, TURBO PASCAL, DELPHI, VISUAL BASIC, VBA, FORTRAN, C, C++, MATLAB
LINUX : C, C++

I've done graphics codes in TP + ASM setup (own libraries).
I've done scientific computations (some CFD, some structural in Fortran and C/C++)
I've done some engineering coding in Matlab scripts, calling some Simulink files...
I enjoy using computer power to generate images, animations, and scientific/engineering results.
